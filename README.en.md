## Key Strategies

### 1. Initial Strategy: Two-Stage Approach

**Brand Logo-Based Hierarchical Classification Design**
- **Stage 1**: Brand logo detection and classification within vehicle images using YOLO model
- **Stage 2**: Detailed vehicle model classification using full vehicle images

**Labeling Strategy**
- Established bounding box criteria and proceeded with data labeling through Roboflow
- Attempted combination of manual labeling and AI auto-labeling (Auto Annotate)
- **Constraint**: Failed to implement due to Roboflow Auto Annotate feature requiring paid tokens

### 2. Pivot Strategy: Single-Stage Classification Model

**Strategic Shift Due to Resource Constraints**
- YOLO-based two-stage approach was postponed due to excessive time and resource consumption
- Unable to train on full dataset (33,000 images) due to GPU memory limitations in Google Colab environment
- **Data Optimization**: Sampled down to 10,000 images considering class balance
- Shifted experimental direction to ResNet and EfficientNet-based classification models
